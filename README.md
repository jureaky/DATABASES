# (COSE371) DATABASES
Notes taken from 2018-01 COSE371 Databases course.
Most materials are from Database System Concepts, 6th ed by Silberschatz, Korth and Sudarshan
and lecture notes by prof. SoonYoung Jung.
Basically follows the book contents, but not all covered.

For summarizing what I've learnt, studying English, and probably for future reference.
