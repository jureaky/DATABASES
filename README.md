# (COSE371) DATABASES
Notes taken from 2018-01 COSE371 Databases course.</br>
Most materials are from Database System Concepts, 6th ed by Silberschatz, Korth and Sudarshan</br>
and lecture notes by prof. SoonYoung Jung.</br>
Basically follows the book contents, but not all covered.

For summarizing what I've learnt, studying English, and probably for future reference.
